-This week I've been brainstorming with Jin Yu about people and plants and have chosen a direction to go in. We can easily tell when our pets are bored, angry or unwell by their sounds and movements, but caring for plants is not so easy. Nowadays, with the rise in material living standards, more and more potted plants are being introduced into people's homes, which are often used for decorative purposes while neglecting the plants' state of life, which can be a chronic torture for them in the long term. So in this project, we look at how plants face danger and explore how to bring plants and people closer together. In order to foster a closer relationship between people and plants, we nest the relationship between the 'carer' and the 'cared for and in this way strengthen this bond, promoting a greater appreciation of plants.

In order to be able to better visualise the living state of the plant, we use a series of physical means to give the plant a personified character and at the same time establish a living fragment between the human and the plant. We plan to use soil moisture sensors to monitor the dryness and wetness of the plant's soil. When the plant is in a state of dehydration, the thermal element, LCD screen, sound card, and LED matrix light will pick up the signal and transmit the temperature, sound, and expression respectively, in addition, we use distance sensors to bring the human and plant closer together. At the same time, the plant may say hi and when the person leaves the plant may say bye.

However, when Jin Yu and I presented our project in class, our teacher and classmates suggested that we could monitor the plants' health in various ways, such as lighting, environment, and so on, and also asked us to look up some relevant literature for reference.

In order to achieve better intimacy between people and plants, we replaced the previous matrix screen with an LCD display to implement monitoring of changes in plant temperature and humidity and attached touch sensors to the plants so that when people touch the plants, they will make a sound.

In addition, a leaf is extended around the plant, in which the previous ceramic heater is placed, and a breathing light is attached to the leaf for better visualisation of the plant's survival.

**Week7 modelling 3d printing - planter making**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After deciding what we wanted to make, we then completed the purchase of the missing sensors at amazon, but because of the long delivery time we decided to make the model of the plant and the pot first this week. We started by building out the model of the plant in c4d and 3d printing it.

![Cow7](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week7.1.png "Cow7")

However, as the school's appointment times were beyond what we could accept, we had to find the equipment for 3d printing at our own expense. During the first printing process, we opted for light-curing printing in order to pursue the ultimate effect of light transmission. However, the linear support structure of the model was unstable, so it led to the support collapsing during the printing process and the model could not be punched out smoothly.

For the second time, we chose TPU material in order to ensure that the model could be printed smoothly. During the printing process, we cut the structure of the model in order to guarantee the stability of the support before it could be printed smoothly.

After the leaves were completed, we decided to assemble the model of the flowerpot ourselves in order to avoid unnecessary time wastage. Start by drawing a sketch of the flowerpot.

The wood was then purchased to be cut and the box to hold the flower pots, as well as the Arduino, was assembled.

**Week 8 - Circuits and soldering**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last week, we have built the leaf model and the potting box, and at the same time the sensor equipment from amazon has arrived, but confusingly the ceramic heater we bought is 12v, and as Jin Yu and I both have mac computers borrowed a windows host from a friend to keep our computers from being damaged, so we were able to start. We decided to solder the circuits and connect the sensors and test if they worked this week. As Eagle, Kicad, and Tinkercad did not have the sensors we needed, we chose to use fritzing to draw out the wiring diagrams. and to list the individual interfaces in an Excel sheet.    

![Cow16](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week8.1.png "Cow16")

In fritzing, it was found that power could be applied and we then started to connect the soldered copper plates as well as the sensor connectors and connect the wiring.

Making touch sensors

![Cow19](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week8.4.jpeg "Cow19")

After the circuit was connected, we powered up the Arduino board to the computer and found that the Arduino board lights did not come on, so we had to check each sensor wiring connection one by one.

![Cow21](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week8.6.jpeg "Cow21")

It was found that some of the sensor's 5v was miswired to GND and that the Mp3 player was soldered with the 5v and GND solder stuck together during the soldering process.

![Cow22](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week8.7.jpeg "Cow22")

We then rewired and removed the excess solder from the Mp3 player with a solder picker before powering it up.

**Week 9 - Code and testing**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After testing the sensors last week, we continued to write and test the code in parallel this week and prepared this week's presentation by first editing the overall logic and documenting it in a documented form.

**1**. When the temperature (below or above 20°C to 32°C) and the soil (humidity less than 40%) are not normal, the mp3 makes a sound (recorded audio in mp3 format and imported into the player module), the heating ceramic of the artificial leaves heats up and the red breathing light comes on.
**2**. When the temperature and humidity are normal: the mp3 plays a greeting audio when a person approaches the plant through distance sensing.
**3**. Under normal temperature and humidity conditions: when a person comes out to touch the leaves, the mp3 plays the corresponding audio.

**Input**
Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
Soil Moisture Sensor
DHT-11(Temperature sensor) 
touch sensor

**Output**
CQRobot Speaker (Mp3 Player)
thermostatic heating element
RGB OLED Display
WS2812 breakout Board

First we referenced the libraries we had written, then we tested the distance, humidity and temperature sensors we had written and found that everything worked.

During subsequent writing, the logic in the if and else took a long time and there were always problems with the OLED display screen font and a high refresh rate during the code run.

![Cow25](https://github.com/yrrrng/22-23-Creative-Making-Advanced-Physical-Computing_Shaohua-Yang_21003575/raw/main/project%20image/week9.2.jpeg "Cow25")

We spent a few hours looking for a simple example to illustrate it on classmates and Arduino reference material and finally solved it in WAVEShare.

Once this problem was solved, we ran the code again and found that the ceramic heater could not be heated successfully within 30 seconds, so to avoid this we set the heating time to 60 seconds.

However, during the final test we again found that when the soil moisture sensor and the touch sensor were inserted into the soil at the same time, the touch sensor and the soil moisture formed a loop and interfered with each other, resulting in the data not being read correctly. The problem was solved by separating the touch sensor from the soil moisture sensor and attaching the touch sensor to the surface of the leaf with insulating tape in order for the data to work properly.

We finally placed the connected sensors in the box, but the box was so small that many of the pins were broken, so we had to spend time reconnecting them, and after this was done we replaced the recorded audio with the file we had tested before, and placed the ceramic heating plate and the ws2812 lamp in the 3d printed leaf to re-run the circuit. Fortunately, the code works!
