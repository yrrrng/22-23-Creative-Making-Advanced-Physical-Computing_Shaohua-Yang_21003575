-This week I've been brainstorming with Jin Yu about people and plants and have chosen a direction to go in. We can easily tell when our pets are bored, angry or unwell by their sounds and movements, but caring for plants is not so easy. Nowadays, with the rise in material living standards, more and more potted plants are being introduced into people's homes, which are often used for decorative purposes while neglecting the plants' state of life, which can be a chronic torture for them in the long term. So in this project, we look at how plants face danger and explore how to bring plants and people closer together. In order to foster a closer relationship between people and plants, we nest the relationship between the 'carer' and the 'cared for and in this way strengthen this bond, promoting a greater appreciation of plants.

In order to be able to better visualise the living state of the plant, we use a series of physical means to give the plant a personified character and at the same time establish a living fragment between the human and the plant. We plan to use soil moisture sensors to monitor the dryness and wetness of the plant's soil. When the plant is in a state of dehydration, the thermal element, LCD screen, sound card, and LED matrix light will pick up the signal and transmit the temperature, sound, and expression respectively, in addition, we use distance sensors to bring the human and plant closer together. At the same time, the plant may say hi and when the person leaves the plant may say bye.

However, when Jin Yu and I presented our project in class, our teacher and classmates suggested that we could monitor the plants' health in various ways, such as lighting, environment, and so on, and also asked us to look up some relevant literature for reference.

In order to achieve better intimacy between people and plants, we replaced the previous matrix screen with an LCD display to implement monitoring of changes in plant temperature and humidity and attached touch sensors to the plants so that when people touch the plants, they will make a sound.

In addition, a leaf is extended around the plant, in which the previous ceramic heater is placed, and a breathing light is attached to the leaf for better visualisation of the plant's survival.

**Week7 modelling 3d printing - planter making**

After deciding what we wanted to make, we then completed the purchase of the missing sensors at amazon, but because of the long delivery time we decided to make the model of the plant and the pot first this week. We started by building out the model of the plant in c4d and 3d printing it.
